Subject: [PATCH 17/28] ARM: dts: omap4-var-som: configure connection to PMIC
 on Variscite's SOM

Now that typical OMAP4 to PMIC connection is defined
in a separate .dtsi file, ve can configure properly OMAP4
pins connected to TWL6030 by just including it.

Include that configuration file for Variscite's SOM.
