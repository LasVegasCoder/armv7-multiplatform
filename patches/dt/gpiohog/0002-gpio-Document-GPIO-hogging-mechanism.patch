 cells in a gpio-specifier.
 
+The GPIO chip may contain GPIO hog definitions. GPIO hogging is a mechanism
+providing automatic GPIO request and configuration as part of the
+gpio-controller's driver probe function.
+
+Each GPIO hog definition is represented as a child node of the GPIO controller.
+Required properties:
+- gpio-hog:  A property specifying that this child node represent a GPIO hog.
+- gpios:     Store the GPIO information (id, flags, ...). Shall contain the
+	     number of cells specified in its parent node (GPIO controller
+	     node).
+- state:     A property specifying the direction/value needed. This property
+	     can take the following values: input, output-high, output-low.
+
+Optional properties:
+- line-name: The GPIO label name. If not present the node name is used.
