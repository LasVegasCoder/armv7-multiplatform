Subject: [PATCH 1/9] ARM: dts: tps65217: Specify the interrupt controller

TPS65217 MFD driver supports the IRQ domain to handle the charger input
interrupts and push button status event. The interrupt controller enables
corresponding IRQ handling in the charger[*] and power button driver[**].

[*]  drivers/power/supply/tps65217_charger.c
[**] drivers/input/misc/tps65218-pwrbutton.c
