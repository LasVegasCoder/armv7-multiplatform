Subject: [PATCH 8/9] PM / OPP: Don't WARN on multiple calls to
 dev_pm_opp_set_regulators()

If a platform specific OPP driver has called this routine first and set
the regulators, then the second call from cpufreq-dt driver will hit the
WARN_ON(). Remove the WARN_ON(), but continue to return error in such
cases.
