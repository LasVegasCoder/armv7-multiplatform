Subject: [PATCH 2/7] ARM: dts: Fix missing usb0_reset for sun4i / sun5i

The recent sun4i-usb-phy changes to add (preliminary) support for the oth phy,
cause the ehci/ohci controllers to no longer work on sun4i / sun5i, because
the phy driver refuses to load due to a missing usb0_reset reset controller
in the dts files for sun4i / sun5i:

[    0.094293] sun4i-usb-phy 1c13400.phy: failed to get reset usb0_reset
[    0.094326] sun4i-usb-phy: probe of 1c13400.phy failed with error -22

This fixes this.
